These are two scripts for Jupyter Notebook that apply the model from Wall, C. M. (2014), 
Autonomous in situ measurements of estuarine surface PCOâ‚‚: instrument development and initial estuarine observations, to estimate the end point equilibrium for the SEACOW's 
water side. One is for a single time point; one is for time series data so you can apply the model to deployment data. Author of the script is Dr. Phil Bresnahan, with 
contributions from Liz Farquhar.
